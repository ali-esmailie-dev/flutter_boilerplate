   ```

## Structure

The app follows the Clean Architecture principles, with the following structure:

- `lib/`
    - `core/`: Contains Core Utilities that used entire application
    - `features/`:
        - `app`: Initializes the app and sets up the dependency injection.
        - `{features_a}`:
            - `data/`: Contains the data layer responsible for handling data fetching and caching.
            - `domain/`: Defines the core business logic and entities of the app.
            - `presentation/`: Contains the UI layer of the app, including BLOCs, views, and widgets.
    - `main.dart`: Entry point of the application.

## Dependencies

The app utilizes several Flutter packages:

- [bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc): Abstracts business logic from presentation and handles state management.

- [get_it](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it): Provides dependency injection capabilities.
- [mockito](https://pub.dev/packages/mockito): Used for mocking dependencies in unit tests.
- [flutter_test](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_test): Used for writing unit and widget tests.
- [shared_preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences): Handles caching fetched data from the network.
- [slang](https://pub.dev/packages/slang): Handles localization and multilingual support.
